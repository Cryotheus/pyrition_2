# Pull Requests
It's best if you follow the existing code style used, but it's not necessary. If you make a pull request that isn't in the exact format expected, it will be converted into the expected format.  
There are some rules that are mandatory.
-   All Lua files must be in pure Lua, alternatives to already existing operators added specifically to Garry's Mod Lua are unacceptable.
-   File endings must be CRLF.
-   No script errors.
-   If applicable, localize text and provide english localization phrases.
