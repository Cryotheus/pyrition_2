# Pyrition
**NOT YET READY FOR RELEASE**  
Administration mod for Garry's Mod.  
Third rewrite **D:**

Pyrition is a consolidation of everything I want when making all my other addons. A partial list of what it currently is, (or will be) is as follows:
* Administration tool
* Common functions library
* Easy to use command system (from a developer perspective)
* Extension loader
* Permission and restriction control
* Play time tracker
* Sandbox improvements

Some of my projects will be rewritten using Pyrition. Yet another partial list is as follows:
* [E2] Game Core
* Optimod
* Player Expression Canvas
* Void Event
* War Lab
