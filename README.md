**NOT YET READY FOR RELEASE**  
Third rewrite **D:**

Pyrition is a consolidation of everything I want when making all my other addons. A partial list of what it currently is, (or will be) is as follows:
*   Administration tool
*   Common functions library
*   Easy to use command system (from a developer perspective)
*   Extension loader
*   MySQL support
*   Permission and restriction control
*   Play time tracker
*   Sandbox improvements

Some of my projects will be rewritten using Pyrition. Yet another partial list is as follows:
*   [E2] Game Core
*   Optimod
*   Player Expression Canvas
*   Void Event
*   War Lab
